# Java Basic Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create your own class and make it output a "Hello world" message.

## Introduction

You should create a class with a static method that prints the "Hello world"
message. There's already a `Main.java` file with a `Main` class as an example in
this repo's source folder. Feel free to go through it if you're stuck.

## Instructions

- Your class must be saved in a file that has the same name as your class. For
  example, `SampleClass` must saved in a file named `SampleClass.java`
- Your class must have a `public static void main(String[] args)` method in
  order to be runnable from the command line
- You will compile your class with the `javac` command on the command line, e.g.
  `javac SampleClass.java`
- You will then run your class with the `java` command on the command line, e.g.
  `java SampleClass`
- The instruction to print text on the screen is
  `System.out.println("message here");`
